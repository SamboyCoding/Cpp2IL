     * IMPORTANT:
     * TECHNICALLY all of the counts are defined as int32_t (except for metadataUsagesCount which is size_t for some reason).
     * However, this struct is aligned/packed to the native pointer width, so we actually just treat these as a bunch of ulongs (i.e. pointers/native-width uints), and the padding (4*00 bytes after each count) is ignored.
     * This is (probably?) a little bit more performant than aligning (i.e. setting the stream position, i.e. seeking) after reading each count.
     * Future: Does this cause issues with little-endian vs big-endian? I've not actually come across a big-endian system - or binary - to test this on.
     *
     * Regardless of how we do it, the fact of the matter is that the count fields are (as well as the pointers which of course are) in practice [pointer size] bytes before the next field, not always 4,
     * so when calculating the total size of this struct, we need to take that into account.
